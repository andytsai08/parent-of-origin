# Parent of Origin with Haplotype Phasing for Multiple Sclerosis 
This is the R pipeline I developed for the Oksenberg Lab to detect parent-of-origin effects in multiple sclerosis using haplotype phasing. This pipeline prepares PLINK files (.bed, .bim, and .fam files) for the many different analyses that can be conducted with parent-of-origin software PREMIM and EMIM, as well as haplotype phasing software SHAPEIT.
